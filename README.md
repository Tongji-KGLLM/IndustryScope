## ‚úèÔ∏è Hightlights
- üéØ **Top Open-Source Urban Knowledge Graph Dataset**
  
IndustryScopeKG is the first and largest open-source, multimodal large-scale knowledge graph dataset. It integrates geospatial data such as street view images, points of interest, and crowd activities, along with socio-economic data including company information, real estate prices, and population statistics. The dataset contains 2,232,037 entities and 51,684,939 triples.

- üéØ **First Application of LLM in Industrial Park Planning and Operations**

The IndustryScopeGPT framework was developed to enhance the planning, action, and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in industrial park planning and operations. This framework represents the first integration of large language models with spatial computing and dynamic reasoning on graph databases that incorporate external geospatial data, marking the first exploration of such applications in industrial park planning and operations.

## üîó IndustryscopeKG Data

The **raw data** is available for download from **[Kaggle](your-kaggle-link)**.

For seamless integration, we recommend using **Neo4j** to analyze and interact with the knowledge graph.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started with Neo4j

We provide a **Neo4j Docker Image** to simplify the process of setting up and working with the IndustryScopeKG dataset.

### Step 1: Install Docker

Ensure you have Docker installed on your system. For installation instructions, visit [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).

### Step 2: Start Neo4j with IndustryScopeKG

Run the following command to start a Neo4j container with the dataset preloaded:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name industryscope-neo4j \
  -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password \
  -v /path/to/your/induscopekg-data:/data \
  neo4j:latest
```

Replace ```/path/to/your/induscopekg-data``` with the path to the directory containing the dataset.

**Default credentials**:
- **Username**: `neo4j`
- **Password**: `password` (you can customize this in the `NEO4J_AUTH` variable).


### Step 3: Access Neo4j

1. Open your browser and navigate to: [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474).
2. Login with the credentials you set (`neo4j/password`).


### Step 4: Import IndustryScopeKG into Neo4j (If needed)

Run the following Cypher commands in the Neo4j browser to load the dataset:

```cypher
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///path/to/your/induscopekg-data.csv' AS row
CREATE (e:Entity {id: row.entity_id, name: row.entity_name, type: row.entity_type})
```

Replace the file path (```file:///path/to/your/induscopekg-data.csv```) with the actual location of your dataset CSV file.

abstract = {Industrial parks are critical to urban economic growth. Yet, their development often encounters challenges stemming from imbalances between industrial requirements and urban services, underscoring the need for strategic planning and operations. This paper introduces IndustryScopeKG, a pioneering large-scale multi-modal, multi-level industrial park knowledge graph, which integrates diverse urban data including street views, corporate, socio-economic, and geospatial information, capturing the complex relationships and semantics within industrial parks. Alongside this, we present the IndustryScopeGPT framework, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) with Monte Carlo Tree Search to enhance tool-augmented reasoning and decision-making in Industrial Park Planning and Operation (IPPO). Our work significantly improves site recommendation and functional planning, demonstrating the potential of combining LLMs with structured datasets to advance industrial park management. This approach sets a new benchmark for intelligent IPPO research and lays a robust foundation for advancing urban industrial development.
